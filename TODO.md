2. Implement core middleware (auth, validation, security)
3. Add basic admin routes
4. Implement driver management basics

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)  
1. Implement escrow system
2. Add auto-assignment service
3. Implement real-time tracking
4. Add payment processing enhancements

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
